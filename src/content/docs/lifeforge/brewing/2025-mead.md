title: Mead-Base 2025
---

This is our Base mead recepe for the year 2025.

For this year, we've gone for "fast and fruity", focussing on agressive fermentation with lots of fruity undertones.

Using a Kveik and enzymes to get a dry, fresh and fruity end result.
We've focussed on melomels, but one can add 450-900g of extra honey and make a basic
mead instead using the same recepe!

Due to the focus on fast and easy ferments, we've focussed on juice-based melomels instead of solid fruits. In general this is a great base recepe for people new to fermenting who want a fail-safe cyser.
